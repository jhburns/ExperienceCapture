# Mongo Database

Application level data is all stored in [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/).
It was chosen due to supporting schemeless documents, (see: https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/why-schemaless)
which is important since it is difficult to know what data will be produced by the client.

Additionally, see the [MongoDB C# driver docs](http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.9/getting_started/quick_tour/).
