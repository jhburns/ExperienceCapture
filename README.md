# Experience Capture

The project aims to simplify and empower data collection from interactive technologies.

It uses a client-server model to do so, and is broken down into these folders:

- *ExampleUnityGame/* is an example game using the client.
- *ClientDevelopmentGame/* is a game used to develop the client. 
- *SetupTestGame/* is a game for testing how easy/possible it is to integrate into the asset into a new game. 
- *Server/* is a backend service for collection and analyzing data. 

## Setup

All of the games only need Unity 2018.2.11f, link: https://unity3d.com/unity/whatsnew/unity-2018.2.11.

See the *Server/* README for setup info about that.
