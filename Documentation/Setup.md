# Setup

This is assuming the Unity game doesn't have Experience Capture in it already, an
upgrade guide will come later. The *SetupTestGame/* folder has an example 
game that can have the client integrated into it for reference.

### Download Asset Package

Get the client [here](https://github.com/jhburns/ExperienceCapture/releases/tag/1.0.0) or in
the same folder as the docs if in Google Drive. 

Click on the first link 'ExperienceCaptureClient.unitypackage' to download it, no extraction needed.

### Import Into Unity Game
