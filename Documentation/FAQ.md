# Frequently Asked Questions

### What types of values can be captured?

JSON has a limited number of data types, mainly:
- Boolean
- Number (int or float)
- String

See [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures) for
more information about types. 

### What happens if the game crashes/etc?



### How can I change the client?

See the properties on the CaptureSetup prefab in the Unity Editor. There isn't documentation
on it yet, but hovering over properties has tool-tips that should help explain.
