- {{ id }}.onlyCaptures.json: Only data collected from the GetCapture() method.
- {{ id }}.sessionInfo.json: Extra info about the session, from the client.
- CSVs/ : all of the GetCapture() data, with one file per scene converted to a CSV format.
- extras/{{ id }}.database.json: Extra info about the session, from the server.
- extras/{{ id }}.raw.json: A straight dump of the session information. Only really useful in the case export didn't work correctly.
